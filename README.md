#WLM-geocoder

## Description

I created the  [Mokuji](https://github.com/Tuxion/mokuji) component [WLM-table-gen](https://github.com/VDK/WLM-table-gen-2) that allows users to create a Dutch Wikipedia page for lists of municipal monuments out of a CSV file. 
For people who would like to addapt the geocoding feature I've created this simplified project.
